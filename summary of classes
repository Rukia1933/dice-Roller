Call the random() function on an IntRange to generate a random number: (1..6).random()
Classes are like a blueprint of an object. They can have properties and behaviors, implemented as variables and functions.
An instance of a class represents an object, often a physical object, such as a dice. You can call the actions on the object and change its attributes.
You can supply values to a class when you create an instance. For example: class Dice(val numSides: Int) and then create an instance with Dice(6).
Functions can return something. Specify the data type to be returned in the function definition, and use a return statement in the function body to return something. For example: fun example(): Int { return 5 }


Add a Button in an Android app using the Layout Editor.
Modify the MainActivity.kt class to add interactive behavior to the app.
Pop up a Toast message as a temporary solution to verify you're on the right track.
Set an on-click listener for a Button using setOnClickListener() to add behavior for when a Button is clicked.
When the app is running, you can update the screen by calling methods on the TextView, Button, or other UI elements in the layout.
